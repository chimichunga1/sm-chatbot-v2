Classic loop issue — sounds like your login state isn’t being persisted or detected correctly after Google Auth finishes. Here’s a quick checklist to help fix it:

1. Check Your Auth Listener

Make sure you’re listening for authentication state changes properly (especially in React apps). Something like:

import { onAuthStateChanged } from "firebase/auth";

useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
    if (user) {
      navigate("/dashboard"); // or however you route
    } else {
      navigate("/login");
    }
  });

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);

This makes sure the app knows when a user logs in or out.

2. Google Auth Flow

Make sure you’re not just signing in but also correctly setting the user state:

import { signInWithPopup, GoogleAuthProvider } from "firebase/auth";

const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();

signInWithPopup(auth, provider)
  .then((result) => {
    // maybe store user in state/context
    navigate("/dashboard"); // or set a redirect
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Login error", error);
  });

3. Redirect vs Navigate

If you’re using navigate("/dashboard"), double-check that your routing isn’t getting overridden somewhere else — especially after signInWithPopup.

Also check you’re not accidentally navigating back to login with something like:

navigate("/login") // that runs on mount before Firebase knows the user is logged in

Wrap logic like that inside onAuthStateChanged.

4. Session Persistence

Double-check you’re setting session persistence if needed:

import { setPersistence, browserLocalPersistence } from "firebase/auth";

setPersistence(auth, browserLocalPersistence)
  .then(() => {
    return signInWithPopup(auth, provider);
  })
  .then((result) => {
    navigate("/dashboard");
  });



⸻

TL;DR Fix
	•	Ensure you’re using onAuthStateChanged at app load.
	•	Don’t redirect to login unless you’re sure the user is not authenticated.
	•	Set browserLocalPersistence if needed.
	•	Only navigate("/dashboard") after login success or in the auth listener.
