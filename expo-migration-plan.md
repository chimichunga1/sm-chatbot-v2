# PriceBetter.ai Expo Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to migrate the PriceBetter.ai web application to a native mobile app using Expo. The migration will be completed in phases to ensure minimal disruption to the existing web application while gradually introducing mobile-specific features and optimizations.

## Current Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18.3 with TypeScript
- UI Framework: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- State Management: React Query + Zustand
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- Backend: Express.js with PostgreSQL database
- AI Integration: OpenAI and Anthropic APIs
- Third-party Integration: Xero API

## Target Mobile Tech Stack
- Framework: Expo SDK (latest stable version)
- Language: TypeScript
- UI: React Native components with NativeBase or Tamagui
- Navigation: React Navigation
- State Management: Same as web (React Query + Zustand)
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication for React Native
- Backend Connection: Same REST API endpoints
- Storage: AsyncStorage for local data

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Component Analysis

### Setup Expo Project
```bash
# Install Expo CLI globally
npm install -g expo-cli

# Create a new Expo project
npx create-expo-app pricebetter-mobile --template blank-typescript

# Navigate to the project
cd pricebetter-mobile

# Install necessary dependencies
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
npm install firebase @firebase/auth-react-native
npm install @tanstack/react-query zustand
npm install axios
```

### Component Mapping Strategy
Create a mapping document for each component in the web application to its mobile equivalent:

| Web Component | Mobile Component | Status | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|--------|-------|
| Button | Custom Button | Not Started | Need to replicate variants |
| Input | TextInput | Not Started | Add styling to match web |
| Card | View with styling | Not Started | |
| Dialog | Modal | Not Started | |
| Toast | Custom Alert | Not Started | |
| Tabs | TabView | Not Started | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Phase 2: Core Structure Implementation

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Implement Firebase Auth for React Native
   - Create login, registration screens
   - Set up protected routes

2. **Navigation Structure**
   - Bottom tabs for main navigation (Quotes, Training, Settings)
   - Stack navigation for nested flows
   - Drawer for additional options

3. **API Connection Layer**
   - Create API client with proper error handling
   - Implement React Query hooks similar to web version
   - Set up auth token management

4. **Theme & Styling System**
   - Create theme constants matching web palette
   - Develop responsive sizing utilities
   - Implement dark mode support

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation

1. **Quotes Management**
   - Quote listing screen with pull-to-refresh
   - Quote detail view with editing capabilities
   - Quote creation flow
   - Line item management

2. **AI Chat Interface**
   - Implement chat UI for mobile
   - Add voice input capabilities
   - Optimize AI response rendering

3. **Training Module**
   - Implement training data management
   - System prompt configuration

4. **User & Settings**
   - User profile management
   - Settings configuration
   - Xero integration

## Phase 4: Mobile-Specific Enhancements

1. **Native Features**
   - Camera integration for document scanning
   - Push notifications for quote updates
   - Offline capability with sync
   - Share quotes via native share dialog

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement list virtualization
   - Optimize image handling
   - Reduce bundle size

3. **User Experience**
   - Add haptic feedback
   - Implement gesture-based interactions
   - Improve animations and transitions

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for API interactions
   - UI testing with React Native Testing Library
   - Device testing matrix (iOS/Android, different screen sizes)

2. **Beta Testing**
   - TestFlight for iOS
   - Google Play Beta for Android
   - Collect feedback from selected users

3. **Production Deployment**
   - App Store submission
   - Google Play submission
   - CI/CD pipeline setup

## Migration Challenges & Solutions

### Shared Code Strategy
- Create a shared package for common business logic
- Use TypeScript for type safety across platforms
- Extract API client and data models to shared library

### UI Differences
- Accept that certain UI patterns will need to be reimagined
- Focus on matching functionality first, then appearance
- Create a mobile-specific design system inspired by web

### Authentication
- Use Firebase Auth across platforms
- Implement secure token storage on mobile
- Ensure smooth session handling

### Data Synchronization
- Implement proper caching for offline support
- Add conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Consider using optimistic UI updates

## Timeline Estimation

1. **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks
2. **Phase 2**: 4-6 weeks
3. **Phase 3**: 6-8 weeks
4. **Phase 4**: 4-5 weeks
5. **Phase 5**: 3-4 weeks

**Total estimated time**: 19-26 weeks (4-6 months)
